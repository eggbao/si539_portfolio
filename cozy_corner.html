			Designing for mental wellness in moments that matter
		</h3>
		<p>
			I designed Cozy Corner for the Business + Tech Innovation Jam, a six-week
			design challenge focused on creating innovative solutions for real-world
			problems. Our team tackled mental health accessibility for young adults by
			building an app that combines peer support, wellness mini-games, and
			on-demand therapy chat in one cohesive experience. I led user research,
			created the core user flow and visual design, and developed 3D assets to
			bring the app’s home ecosystem to life.
		</p>

		<h2 id="the-problem">THE PROBLEM</h2>
		<h3 id="young-adults-need-mental-health-support-right-when-they-need-it">
			Young adults need mental health support right when they need it
		</h3>
		<p>
			Nearly 25% of adults in the U.S. experience mental health issues, yet
			accessing treatment in the moment remains nearly impossible. 60% of people
			say it’s critical to find support right when they need it, not days or
			weeks later through appointments and paperwork.
		</p>
		<p>
			Young adults face compounding barriers: long wait times, difficulty being
			vulnerable, and a desire for real human connection over AI chatbots.
			Existing wellness apps either gamify mental health without real clinical
			support, or provide therapy access but lack the engagement that keeps
			users coming back.

		<h2 id="user-research">USER RESEARCH</h2>
		<h3 id="surveying-students-to-understand-mental-health-pain-points">
			Surveying students to understand mental health pain points
		</h3>
		<p>
			Mikang and I co-led the research phase. We crafted a Google Form survey
			and distributed it across campus through word of mouth and student Discord
			servers. Our goal was to understand how young adults currently approach
			mental health support and what gaps exist in their experience.
		</p>
		<h3 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h3>
		<p>After analyzing responses, we identified four critical pain points:</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Need for human connection</strong><br />
			“Availability of human resources. AI tools are always available but have a
			lot of pitfalls.”
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Hard to be vulnerable</strong><br />
			“I find it’s difficult to open up about struggles, even to the people that
			I’m close to and know well.”
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Long wait times</strong><br />
			“I wish I didn’t have to make an appointment or go through paperwork to
			see a licensed professional and be anonymous.”
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Barriers to accessibility</strong><br />
			“Making it more accessible and bringing awareness so people know about the
			resources.”
		</p>
		<p>
			These insights confirmed our hypothesis: young adults need a solution that
			is immediate, human, low-barrier, and emotionally safe.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 id="ideation">IDEATION</h2>
		<h3 id="defining-core-features-through-team-brainstorming">
			Defining core features through team brainstorming
		</h3>
		<p>
			With our research findings in hand, the team held brainstorming sessions
			to define what Cozy Corner would be. We knew we wanted to blend gaming
			with mental health support, but the challenge was figuring out how to make
			therapy feel natural within a game environment.
		</p>
		<p>We landed on three core features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Social spaces:</strong> Meet and chat with other players for
				peer support
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Wellness mini-games:</strong> Practice mental health concepts
				through engaging, offline-capable games<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Therapy chat:</strong> Live chat with licensed professionals
				when users need immediate support
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="the-home-ecosystem-metaphor">The Home Ecosystem Metaphor</h3>
		<p>
			The biggest design challenge was integrating therapy chat into the user
			flow without it feeling clinical or separate from the rest of the game. I
			was taking a course on cognitive psychology in human-computer interaction
			at the time, and we were learning about design metaphors. I realized that
			a home ecosystem could serve as the connective tissue for all our
			features.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instead of treating therapy chat as a separate tab, I designed the user’s
			avatar home as the central hub where every feature is accessible through
			intuitive, spatial interactions. Users could click on a computer to play
			mini-games, tap a large button to access therapy chat, and walk through a
			door to enter social spaces.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I presented this concept during our first feedback round with
			mentors, one mentor challenged me to think deeper about how to make the
			therapy integration feel even more seamless. That conversation pushed me
			to refine the flow and consider user incentives.
		</p>

		<h2 id="design-process">DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
		<h3 id="from-sticky-notes-to-high-fidelity-prototypes">
			From sticky notes to high-fidelity prototypes
		</h3>
		<p><strong>Early Sketches</strong></p>
		<p>
			I started with small sketches on sticky notes to quickly explore different
			layouts and flows. These sketches required constant back-and-forth with my
			team. I would create iterations, and Mikang and Richard would provide
			feedback on possible tweaks or alternative approaches.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</strong></p>
		<p>
			Once we had a clear direction, Mikang and I translated the sketches into
			mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma. At this stage, we focused on structure
			and user flow without worrying about visual polish. I also created a
			detailed user flow chart in Figma to map out every interaction and
			decision point within the app.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Visual Design and Branding</strong></p>
		<p>
			Before moving to high-fidelity, we developed a mini style guide with a
			color palette and mood board to define the vibe we wanted: warm,
			approachable, and calming. I also designed the Cozy Corner logo in
			Photoshop to establish brand identity early.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the style direction locked in, I translated the wireframes into
			high-fidelity prototypes in Figma. I handled the majority of this work,
			though Mikang contributed feedback and refinements along the way.
		</p>
		<p><strong>3D Modeling</strong></p>
		<p>
			To bring the home ecosystem to life, I used Blender to create 3D models
			for the prototype, including the avatar’s home and environmental elements.
			This added depth and immersion, making the interface feel more like a
			space users could inhabit.
		</p>

		<h2 id="iteration-user-testing">ITERATION &amp; USER TESTING</h2>
		<h3 id="refining-based-on-mentor-and-judge-feedback">
			Refining based on mentor and judge feedback
		</h3>
		<p>
			Throughout the six-week jam, we received feedback from mentors and judges
			at multiple checkpoints. The most valuable feedback focused on the therapy
			chat integration and user flow.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Making Therapy Feel Seamless</strong></p>
		<p>
			Judges pointed out that while the home ecosystem was a strong concept, the
			transition from playing games to accessing therapy still felt slightly
			disjointed. They encouraged us to think about visual cues, transition
			animations, and contextual prompts that could guide users naturally into
			the therapy space.
		</p>
		<p><strong>User Incentives</strong></p>
		<p>
			Another piece of critical feedback was around user motivation. What would
			keep users engaged with the app long-term? This led us to introduce an
			in-game currency system. Users could earn currency by interacting with
			wellness mini-games, chatting with peers in social spaces, and using the
			therapy chat.
		</p>
		<p>
			We decided that therapy chat would reward the most currency, subtly
			incentivizing users to engage with professional support while still making
			it feel like a natural part of the game loop.

		<h2 id="outcomes">OUTCOMES</h2>
		<h3 id="advancing-to-the-first-round-of-judging">
			Advancing to the first round of judging
		</h3>
		<p>
			Out of 80 teams in the Business + Tech Innovation Jam, Cozy Corner
			advanced to the first round of judging, where 53 teams competed. While we
			didn’t make it to the final five, the experience was invaluable.
		</p>
		<p>
			The judges particularly appreciated our research-driven approach and the
			home ecosystem concept. They saw the potential in blending gamification
			with clinical support, and their feedback on flow and incentives gave us a
			clear roadmap for what a next iteration could look like.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<h2 id="reflections">REFLECTIONS</h2>
		<h3 id="design-metaphors-create-cohesion">
			Design metaphors create cohesion
		</h3>
		<p>
			Using the home ecosystem metaphor was one of the most effective decisions
			I made. It solved a core interaction design challenge by giving users a
			mental model they already understood. This project reinforced how powerful
			metaphors can be when unifying disparate features.
		</p>
		<h3 id="balancing-game-and-clinical-is-hard">
			Balancing game and clinical is hard
		</h3>
		<p>
			One of the hardest challenges was balancing the playful, engaging nature
			of a wellness game with the seriousness of therapy. It’s a delicate line,
			and while we made strong progress, I learned that this balance requires
			constant testing and refinement. In a longer timeline, I would have loved
			to conduct usability testing to see how users actually experienced that
			transition.
		</p>
		<h3 id="collaboration-under-tight-deadlines">
			Collaboration under tight deadlines
		</h3>
		<p>
			Working with a tight six-week deadline and a small team taught me how to
			prioritize ruthlessly. Not every idea could make it into the prototype,
			and we had to make tough calls about what to focus on. I learned to
			embrace feedback as a tool for clarity, not criticism, and to iterate
			quickly without getting precious about any one design decision.
