            Designing for mental wellness in moments that matter
          </h3>
          <p class="right-align">
            I designed Cozy Corner for the University of Michigan Ross Business
            School's Business + Tech Innovation Jam, a six-week design challenge
            focused on creating innovative solutions for real-world problems.
            Our team of three tackled mental health accessibility for young
            adults by building an app that combines peer support, wellness
            mini-games, and on-demand therapy chat in one cohesive experience. I
            led user research, created the core user flow and visual design, and
            developed 3D assets to bring the app's home ecosystem to life.

            Young adults need mental health support right when they need it
          </h3>
          <p>
            Nearly 25% of adults in the U.S. experience mental health issues,
            yet accessing treatment in the moment remains nearly impossible. 60%
            of people say it’s critical to find support right when they need it,
            not days or weeks later through appointments and paperwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            Young adults face compounding barriers: long wait times, difficulty
            being vulnerable, and a desire for real human connection over AI
            chatbots. Existing wellness apps either gamify mental health without
            real clinical support, or provide therapy access but lack the
            engagement that keeps users coming back.

            The product manager and I co-led the research phase. We crafted a
            Google Form survey and distributed it across campus through word of
            mouth and student Discord servers. Our goal was to understand how
            young adults currently approach mental health support and what gaps
            exist in their experience.

            After analyzing responses, we identified four critical pain points:
          </p>
          <div class="small-grid">
            <p>
              <strong>Need for human connection</strong><br />
              “Availability of human resources. AI tools are always available
              but have a lot of pitfalls.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Hard to be vulnerable</strong><br />
              “I find it’s difficult to open up about struggles, even to the
              people that I’m close to and know well.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Long wait times</strong><br />
              “I wish I didn’t have to make an appointment or go through
              paperwork to see a licensed professional and be anonymous.”
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Barriers to accessibility</strong><br />
              “Making it more accessible and bringing awareness so people know
              about the resources.”
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            These insights confirmed our hypothesis: young adults need a
            solution that is immediate, human, low-barrier, and emotionally
            safe.

            Defining core features through team brainstorming
          </h3>
          <p>
            With our research findings in hand, the team held brainstorming
            sessions to define what Cozy Corner would be. We knew we wanted to
            blend gaming with mental health support, but the challenge was
            figuring out how to make therapy feel natural within a game
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>We landed on three core features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Social spaces:</strong> Meet and chat with other players
              for peer support
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wellness mini-games:</strong> Practice mental health
              concepts through engaging, offline-capable games<br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Therapy chat:</strong> Live chat with licensed
              professionals when users need immediate support
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 id="the-home-ecosystem-metaphor">The Home Ecosystem Metaphor</h3>
          <p>
            The biggest design challenge was integrating therapy chat into the
            user flow without it feeling clinical or separate from the rest of
            the game. I was taking a course on cognitive psychology in
            human-computer interaction at the time, and we were learning about
            design metaphors. I realized that a home ecosystem could serve as
            the connective tissue for all our features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of treating therapy chat as a separate tab, I designed the
            user’s avatar home as the central hub where every feature is
            accessible through intuitive, spatial interactions. Users could
            click on a computer to play mini-games, tap a large button to access
            therapy chat, and walk through a door to enter social spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I presented this concept during our first feedback round with
            mentors, one mentor challenged me to think deeper about how to make
            the therapy integration feel even more seamless. That conversation
            pushed me to refine the flow and consider user incentives.

            From sticky notes to high-fidelity prototypes
          </h3>

          <p><strong>Early Sketches</strong></p>
          <p>
            I started with small sketches on sticky notes to quickly explore
            different layouts and flows. These sketches required constant
            back-and-forth with my team. I would create iterations, and the
            product manager and business analyst would provide feedback on
            possible tweaks or alternative approaches.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</strong></p>
          <p>
            Once we had a clear direction, the product manager and I translated
            the sketches into mid-fidelity wireframes in Figma. At this stage,
            we focused on structure and user flow without worrying about visual
            polish. I also created a detailed user flow chart in Figma to map
            out every interaction and decision point within the app.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Visual Design and Branding</strong></p>
          <p>
            Before moving to high-fidelity, we developed a mini style guide with
            a color palette and mood board to define the vibe we wanted: warm,
            approachable, and calming. I also designed the Cozy Corner logo in
            Photoshop to establish brand identity early.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the style direction locked in, I translated the wireframes into
            high-fidelity prototypes in Figma. I handled the majority of this
            work, though the product manager contributed feedback and
            refinements along the way.
          </p>

          <p><strong>3D Modeling</strong></p>
          <p>
            To bring the home ecosystem to life, I used Blender to create 3D
            models for the prototype, including the avatar’s home and
            environmental elements. This added depth and immersion, making the
            interface feel more like a space users could inhabit.

            Refining based on mentor and judge feedback
          </h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the six-week jam, we received feedback from mentors and
            judges at multiple checkpoints. The most valuable feedback focused
            on the therapy chat integration and user flow.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Making Therapy Feel Seamless</strong></p>
          <p>
            Judges pointed out that while the home ecosystem was a strong
            concept, the transition from playing games to accessing therapy
            still felt slightly disjointed. They encouraged us to think about
            visual cues, transition animations, and contextual prompts that
            could guide users naturally into the therapy space.
          </p>

          <p><strong>User Incentives</strong></p>
          <p>
            Another piece of critical feedback was around user motivation. What
            would keep users engaged with the app long-term? This led us to
            introduce an in-game currency system. Users could earn currency by
            interacting with wellness mini-games, chatting with peers in social
            spaces, and using the therapy chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            We decided that therapy chat would reward the most currency, subtly
            incentivizing users to engage with professional support while still
            making it feel like a natural part of the game loop.
