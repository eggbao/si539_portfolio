            <p>
              As Elk Electronics' summer design intern, I led the redesign of
              our mobile charging app, refreshed our public website, and
              developed a new suite of branded docs. This project was an
              opportunity to make at-home EV charging simple and inviting for
              users while balancing technical constraints unique to our
              hardware. My focus was to unify user flow, visual identity, and
              accessibility into one experience for both new and existing
              customers.

          <h3>The Problem: Bridging limitations and user expectations</h3>
          <p>
            With their charger, real-time battery percentage was not available
            during charging sessions. This limitation frustrated our existing
            users. Other EV apps set high expectations for live data and
            granular control. Our challenge was how to streamline the charging
            experience while keeping users confident and informed despite
            hardware constraints.

          <div>
            <h3 class="right-align">Stakeholder and competitor deep-dive</h3>
            <p>
              I began by meeting with Elk Electronics' founders and developer to
              clarify business goals and user pain points. I conducted a rapid
              scan of competing EV apps, benchmarking their UI conventions and
              feature sets. This process revealed two main needs: a clean,
              accessible control flow and a brand identity that signals their
              quality. I translated our shared vision into a detailed style
              guide including colors, typography, and graphic standards. This
              set the stage for cohesive design across our product ecosystem.

        <h2>Mapping & Wireframing</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>User flow as the foundation</h3>
          <p>
            I mapped end-to-end user flows in Miro, outlining every core
            interaction from session start to completion. My goal was to make
            the essential actions easy to find and the next step always clear.
            With these flows in place, I sketched low- and mid-fidelity
            wireframes, testing alternatives with the team.
          </p>
          <p>
            A pivotal design decision came from hardware feedback. Instead of
            granular battery data, the main interface featured a "Start Charge"
            button that changed to "Stop Charge" once active. This choice
            removed confusion and focused on clarity.
          </p>

        <div class="grid grid-left">
          <div>
            <h3 class="left-align">Bringing brand and flow together</h3>
            <p>
              After finalizing the style guide and mid-fidelity wireframes, I
              moved into high-fidelity wireframing in Figma. Each screen layered
              Elk Electronics' brand gradients over clean, accessible layouts.
              Key interface choices like light backgrounds and strong contrast
              boosted readability across devices. Weekly check-ins with
              engineers ensured every visual fit our technical reality. The
              result was a flow that felt unified, modern, and unmistakably
              their brand.

            <p>
              After the initial prototype, my team identified the need for
              informative pop-ups such as charging status and error messages. I
              designed these overlays with clear icons and exit controls. This
              made it easy for users to dismiss notifications and stay focused
              on charging.

            </h3>
            <p>
              By project end, Elk had a unified app flow and style across mobile
              and web. This change made at-home charging simpler and more
              accessible. Internal testers reported less confusion and fewer
              support requests. The modular system I designed now forms the
              baseline for future product enhancements and brand collateral.

        <h3>Designing with constraint is creative</h3>
        <p>
          Working with hardware limits challenged me to focus design energy on
          clarity and simplicity. Establishing a style guide early made team
          communication smoother and reinforced our vision through every
          iteration. I would have liked to conduct richer user feedback and
          external testing in future cycles. This internship strengthened my
          belief that accessible design drives user trust and brand loyalty.
