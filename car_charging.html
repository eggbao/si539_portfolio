    <strong>CONTEXT</strong><br />
    Summer internship with Elk Electronics<br />
    Dublin, Ireland
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <h3>
    Reimagining EV charging for everyday use
  </h3>
  <p>
    As Elk Electronics' summer design intern, I led the redesign of our mobile
    charging app, refreshed our public website, and developed a new suite of
    branded docs. This project was an opportunity to make at-home EV charging
    simple and inviting for users while balancing technical constraints unique
    to our hardware. My focus was to unify user flow, visual identity, and
    accessibility into one experience for both new and existing customers.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
  <h3>
    Bridging hardware limits and user expectations
  </h3>
  <p>
    With their charger, real-time battery percentage was not available during
    charging sessions. This limitation frustrated our existing users. Other EV
    apps set high expectations for live data and granular control. Our
    challenge was how to streamline the charging experience while keeping
    users confident and informed despite hardware constraints.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>RESEARCH & VISION</h2>
  <h3>
    Stakeholder and competitor deep-dive
  </h3>
  <p>
    I began by meeting with Elk Electronics' founders and developer to clarify business
    goals and user pain points. I conducted a rapid scan of competing EV apps,
    benchmarking their UI conventions and feature sets. This process revealed
    two main needs: a clean, accessible control flow and a brand identity that
    signals their quality. I translated our shared vision into a detailed
    style guide including colors, typography, and graphic standards. This set
    the stage for cohesive design across our product ecosystem.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>MAPPING & WIREFRAMING</h2>
  <h3">User flow as the foundation</h3>
    <p>
      I mapped end-to-end user flows in Miro, outlining every core interaction
      from session start to completion. My goal was to make the essential
      actions easy to find and the next step always clear. With these flows in
      place, I sketched low- and mid-fidelity wireframes, testing alternatives
      with the team.<br />
      A pivotal design decision came from hardware feedback. Instead of granular
      battery data, the main interface featured a “Start Charge” button that
      changed to “Stop Charge” once active. This choice removed confusion and
      focused on clarity.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>DESIGN & PROTOTYPE</h2>
    <h3>
      Bringing brand and flow together
    </h3>
    <p>
      After finalizing the style guide, I moved into high-fidelity prototyping
      in Figma. Each screen layered Elk Electronics' brand gradients over clean, accessible
      layouts. Key interface choices like light backgrounds and strong contrast
      boosted readability across devices. Weekly check-ins with engineers
      ensured every visual fit our technical reality. The result was a flow that
      felt unified, modern, and unmistakably their brand.
    </p>

    <h2>ITERATION & MICRO-INTERACTIONS</h2>
    <h3>
      Refining pop-ups for everyday use
    </h3>
    <p>
      After the initial prototype, my team identified the need for informative
      pop-ups such as charging status and error messages. I designed these
      overlays with clear icons and exit controls. This made it easy for users
      to dismiss notifications and stay focused on charging.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>OUTCOMES</h2>
    <h3>
      Clearer, faster charging and cohesive brand
    </h3>
    <p>
      By project end, Elk had a unified app flow and style across mobile and
      web. This change made at-home charging simpler and more accessible.
      Internal testers reported less confusion and fewer support requests. The
      modular system I designed now forms the baseline for future product
      enhancements and brand collateral.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
    <h3>Designing with constraint is creative</h3>
    <p>
      Working with hardware limits challenged me to focus design energy on
      clarity and simplicity. Establishing a style guide early made team
      communication smoother and reinforced our vision through every iteration.
      I would have liked to conduct richer user feedback and external testing in
      future cycles. This internship strengthened my belief that accessible
      design drives user trust and brand loyalty.
